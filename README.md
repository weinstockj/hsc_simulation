# HSC simulation
This repo contains code for simulating hematopoietic stem cell clones with a driver variant in Julia. 
This simulation was used to theoretically demonstrate PACER, as described in [Clonal hematopoiesis is driven by aberrant activation of TCL1A](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.10.471810v1).
